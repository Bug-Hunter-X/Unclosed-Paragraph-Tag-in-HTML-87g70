# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in HTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).  This seemingly minor error can lead to unexpected rendering behavior in browsers, potentially affecting layout and styling.

## Bug Description
The `bug.html` file contains a paragraph tag that lacks its closing tag (`</p>`). This omission breaks the expected structure and can cause the browser to incorrectly interpret the subsequent HTML, affecting the visual rendering.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected HTML code, with the missing closing tag properly added.  This resolves the rendering issues and ensures the HTML is well-formed.

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the rendering differences from the expected output.

## How to Fix the Bug
1. Add the missing closing tag (`</p>`) to the affected paragraph element, as demonstrated in `bugSolution.html`.
2. Ensure all HTML tags are properly closed to prevent rendering and validation errors.
